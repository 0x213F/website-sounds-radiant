    <h2>Improvised Music. Color Evolved.</h2>
    <br>

    <p>
      Josh is a percussionist, specializing in a mostly- traditional trap drum-set, playing music rooted in the jazz tradition. He is inspired by engaging instrumental music, poetry, and narrative based lyrics.
    </p>

    <p>
      In tandem with his live improvised playing, he also creates custom LED light exhibits to go with the music.
    </p>

    <p>
      He began on the empty streets of San Francisco during the COVID pandemic, busking as the drummer in a piano drum duet. The piano player, Tony Martinez, is from Cuba and fuses the heart and soul of Cuba with contemporary American rhythms. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/ChfmQ9IgPvY/">Click here for a sample of Josh and Tony as a duo.</a>

      As society began to open up, Josh started collaborating with other gigging musicians in the San Francisco jazz scene. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cky9-kFyyvN/">Click here for a sample of Josh in a trio setting.</a>
    </p>

    <p>
      Nowadays, Josh runs a musician collective space in San Francisco for professionals to practice, workshop, rehearse, record, and listen to Black Music. It is supported by mutual aid and donations.

      Here are two samples of live music, premeditated by rehearsal, in the studio space. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CpRfnFfAKc6/">Click here for the first sample.</a> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CqAEB7mgnj9/">Click here for the second sample.</a>

      Over the last year, Josh has performed in public spaces, private events, and at notable local venues. He is a regular performer at: Union Station (Cannabis Dispensary), Foreign Lens (Art Gallery), and Ula (Music Restaurant and Bar).
